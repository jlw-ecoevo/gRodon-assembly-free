Code to Generate Figures for "Assembly-Free Short-Read Metagenomic Maximum Growth Rate Prediction" by Natarajan & Weissman

Short read modes implemented directly into [gRodon](https://github.com/jlw-ecoevo/gRodon2) package as modes `metagenome_150bp` and `metagenome_250bp`

Analyses adapted from [Natarajan & Weissman (honors thesis)](https://github.com/jenatarajan/gRodon_HON_Thesis.git)
